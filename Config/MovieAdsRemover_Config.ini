# First, make sure the image you are trying to import is:
# A power-of-two number of pixels across (e.g. 1x1, 16x4, 64x128, 256x256, ...) up to 1024x1024.
# Using 8-bit color (256 color indexed) BMP or PCX for UT; 8-bit indexed BMP or PCX, 24 bit or 32 bit TGA or DDS for UT2003.
# Saved in .pcx or .bmp for UT; saved in .pcx, .bmp, targa, DXT or UPaint for UT2003.
# Import to KF-SDK. In-game they will automatically be downscaled to fit view of w=320 h=240
# This is just an `Image`

# This is a `GIF`

# FPS of the Animated GIF/Texture - if set to 0, FPS will always be same
# as the Player's own FPS. This is sometimes problematic if you have 60+ FPS
# then the animation will be super fast!
